Requires the neurtheor package (see my repo neurtheor [ https://github.com/adityagilra/neurtheor ])

`python lin_response_comparisons_v2.py`
`python lin_response_comparisons.py` (older - doesn't use neurtheor module, simpler plots)

Calculate and plot response of a population of spiking neurons (spike response model) to a constant and a sinusoid riding on top.
Population responses calculated via 3 different methods are compared:
1) via simulation (brian2)
2) via linear response theory using the integral approach (do_integral_approach=True) explained in Gerstner et al book [ http://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/ ].
3) for a LIF neuron, you can also calculate the population response using linear response theory using the differential approach (do_differential_approach=True) from Richardson 2007 [ http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevE.76.021919 ].
